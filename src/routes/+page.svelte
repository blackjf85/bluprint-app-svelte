	Once upon a time, there was a cat who loved to code. She spent all day and night working on her
	website, constantly tweaking and testing until it was purr-fect.

<p class="home__text">
	One day, while taking a break to nap in a sunny spot, the cat had a sudden realization - she had
	forgotten to add a navigation menu to her website! She immediately jumped up and went back to
	coding, determined to fix her mistake.

<p class="home__text">
	After a few hours of work, the cat finally added the navigation menu and was very pleased with
	herself. She decided to take a break and celebrate with a bowl of milk.
